            <h1>Why Ghostwritten?</h1>
            <p>
                Many academic services are staffed by people
                who have not touched a college or high school textbook
                in years, and are out of touch with modern
                curriculums.
            </p>
            <p>
                Others employ unreliable freelancers who face no
                reprecussions for conducting fraud, scams, or rating
                manipulation.
            </p>
